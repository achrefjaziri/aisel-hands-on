## Hands-on material to support teaching of AI Systems Engineering

#### Supported by the BMBF funded Artifical Intelligence Systems Engineering Laboratory (AISEL) project  <img src="pics/BMBF_gefoerdert_2017_en.jpg" width="120">




## Goal
This material supports teaching efforts at the master level for future AI System Engineers and complements existing courses on machine learning and system and software engineering.
It covers basics on probability theory, probabilistic model-building, simulation, robust modules, uncertainty propagation, automatic differentation, deep probabilistic frameworks as well as privacy measures and basics for affective AI. 

<p>A pedestrian tracker example is used to demonstrates the workflow for robust change detection and quantitiave model-based performance measures.</p>
