## Hands-on material to support teaching of AI Systems Engineering

#### Supported by the BMBF funded Artifical Intelligence Systems Engineering Laboratory (AISEL) project  <img src="pics/BMBF_gefoerdert_2017_en.jpg" width="120">




## Goal
This material supports teaching efforts at the master level for future AI System Engineers. 
It contains basics on probability theory, probabilistic model-building, robust modules, uncertainty propagation, automatic differentation, introduction to deep probabilistic frameworks, privacy measures and basics for affective AI.
<p>A pedestrian tracker example is used to demonstrate the full workflow to design and implement robust, modular vision based AI Systems with quantitiave performance measures.</p>
